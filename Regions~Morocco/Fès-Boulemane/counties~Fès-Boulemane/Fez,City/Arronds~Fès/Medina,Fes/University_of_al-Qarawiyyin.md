> The University of al-Qarawiyyin (Arabic: جامعة القرويين, 
> romanized: Jāmiʻat al-Qarawīyīn), also written Al-Karaouine or Al Quaraouiyine, 
> is a university located in [[../../../Fez,City]], [[Morocco]]. 
> 
> It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857–859 and subsequently 
> became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the Islamic Golden Age. I
> 
> t was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963 
> and officially renamed "University of Al Quaraouiyine" two years later. 
> 
> The mosque building itself is also a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture that features elements from many different periods of Moroccan history. 
>
> Scholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II. Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of "university", which they view as a distinctly European invention. They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963. UNESCO and the Guinness World Records, have cited al-Qarawiyyin as the oldest university or oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world.
>
> Education at the University of al-Qarawiyyin concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki Sharia, though lessons on non-Islamic subjects are also offered to students. Teaching is still delivered in the traditional methods. The university is attended by students from all over Morocco and Muslim West Africa, with some also coming from further abroad. Women were first admitted to the institution in the 1940s after the women's movement pressured the French colonial government at the time.
