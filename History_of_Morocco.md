> The history of human habitation in Morocco spans since the Lower Paleolithic, 
> with the earliest known being Jebel Irhoud. 
> 
> Much later Morocco was part of Iberomaurusian culture, including Taforalt. 
> It dates from the establishment of Mauretania and other ancient Berber kingdoms, 
> to the establishment of the Moroccan state by the Idrisid dynasty 
> followed by other Islamic dynasties, through to the colonial and independence periods.
>
> Archaeological evidence has shown that the area was inhabited by hominids at least 400,000 years ago. 
> The recorded history of Morocco begins with the Phoenician colonization of the Moroccan coast 
> between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE, 
> although the area was inhabited by indigenous Berbers for some two thousand years before that. 
> 
> In the 5th century BCE, the city-state of Carthage extended its hegemony over the coastal areas. 
> They remained there until the late 3rd century BCE, while the hinterland was ruled by indigenous monarchs. 
> 
> Indigenous Berber monarchs ruled the territory from the 3rd century BCE until 40 CE, 
> when it was annexed to the Roman Empire. 
> 
> In the mid-5th century CE, it was overrun by Vandals, 
> before being recovered by the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century.
>
> The region was conquered by the Muslims in the early 8th century CE, 
> but broke away from the Umayyad Caliphate after the Berber Revolt of 740. 
> 
> Half a century later, the Moroccan state was established by the Idrisid dynasty. 
> The Saadi dynasty ruled the country from 1549 to 1659, 
> followed by the Alawis from 1667 onwards, who have since been the ruling dynasty of Morocco.
